## Introduction

This project was coded during "La nuit de l'Info", where we spent the whole night to code. The goal was to develop an app to help preventing STD with a serious game.

To this end, we tried to implement a "tower defense" style game, where STD were the enemy and protections like condoms were turrets defeding the body (the fortress)
